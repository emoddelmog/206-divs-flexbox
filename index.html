                <p>I was born and raised in Southern California but I decided at a very early age that I wanted to see other parts of the country and the world. I joined the Peace Corps when I was almost 30 years old and served in both Uganda, E. Africa as well as the Republic of Kiribati in the Central Pacific.<p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>After the Peace Corps, my husband and I took various jobs, mostly in the Western U.S. We drove from Fairbanks, AK, all the way down to the tip of Baja, MX. We lived like gypsies for about 10 years and always had several dogs in tow.<p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>After another trip up to Alaska to work as caretakers for a property on a lake, I decided I was ready to stop living like a gypsy and settle down. I accepted a job teaching Kindergarten in SW Colorado and bought a house. I now live in southern Arizona and I have realized that I belong in the southwest. I love the climate, the topography and the diverse bird, plant and animal life.<p>
